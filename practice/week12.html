    <h1>Genshin Impact</h1>
    <button class="accordion">Introduction to Genshin Impact</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Genshin Impact is a popular action role-playing game developed by miHoYo. Released in September 2020, it
            features an expansive open world filled with stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and rich lore. Set in the
            fantasy world of Teyvat, players control the "Traveler" who searches for their lost sibling while unraveling
            the secrets of each of the seven regions. The game blends exploration, puzzle-solving, and fast-paced combat
            to create an immersive experience.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Characters and Abilities</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>One of Genshin Impact's standout features is its diverse cast of playable characters. Each character wields a
            unique set of elemental abilities, from the fiery power of Pyro to the watery flow of Hydro. Players can
            build a team of up to four characters, each offering different playstyles and elemental synergies. By
            switching between characters mid-combat, players can unleash powerful combos, adding depth and strategy to
            the fast-paced action.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Regular Updates and Events</button>

            quests, and limited-time events. Each update brings fresh storylines, seasonal festivals, and even new
