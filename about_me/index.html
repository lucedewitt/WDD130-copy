    <h2>Luce DeWitt</h2>
    <p>My name is Luce DeWitt and I'm a Computer Science major. I love reading, and enjoy playing board
        games with my family, art, video games, and walking. I have a cat named Strider, he's half blind
        and adorable.</p>
    <p>I'm taking this course because it seems super fun. I took a Web Development class in high school,
        and I really enjoy it. I find the whole process interesting, and it would be cool if I could make
        my own websites. I might do this for my future career, but I haven't decided quite yet. I grew up as
        a member of the church. My favorite scripture might be D&C 88:63 "Seek me dilligently and ye shall 
        find me; ask, and ye shall receive, knock, and it shall be opened unto you" because it's been on my
        wall for as long as I can remember. I also like 2 Nephi 4:20, it helped me when I was going through a
        hard time, and Matthew 6:34, because it reminds me to not worry so much. </p>
