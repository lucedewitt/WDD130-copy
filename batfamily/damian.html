        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Damian is the biological son of Bruce and Talia Al Ghul. He was raised by the League of Assassins, and is a trained assassin. He grew up as heir, so he was both spoiled and abused. When Damian was 10, he was sent to Gotham to meet his father. After learning to kill, and being told that he would be the next Robin, Damian is dissapointed when he father is wary of him. Soon after arriving, with a still rocky relationship with his father, Bruce dies. Alfred gives Damian the Robin suit, and Dick officially makes Damian Robin so he won't return to the League of Assassins.</p>

    <div id="damian-history">
        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>Damian is trained and mentored by Dick as Batman. Dick teaches Damian not to kill, and to have empathy. Damian grows a lot under the care of Dick, and they remain close to this day. When Dick returns from Spyral, Damian is the only one happy to see them. They both believe that "we were the best". Damian is Dick's Robin, and the only one Dick directly passed his mother's nickname to.</p>
        <p>When Bruce returns, Damian becomes his Robin. Though they had a rough start, they do eventually begin to work well together. Later, Damian is killed by his own clone, The Heretic, sent by his mother. Damian is eventually revived by the Chaos Shard. Damian joins the Teen Titans, and is especially close with Jon, Superman's son. Damian is the current Robin in comics, at 14 years old.</p>
