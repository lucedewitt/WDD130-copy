            <h2 class="d-font">Background</h2>
            <p>Damian is the biological son of Bruce and Talia Al Ghul. He was raised by the League of Assassins, and is
                a trained assassin. He grew up as the heir, so he was both spoiled and abused. When Damian was 10, he was
                sent to Gotham to meet his father. After learning to kill, and being told that he would be the next
                Robin, Damian is dissapointed when he father is wary of him. Soon after arriving, with a still rocky
                relationship with his father, Bruce dies. Alfred gives Damian the Robin suit, and Dick officially makes
                Damian Robin so he won't return to the League of Assassins.</p>

        <div id="damian-history">
            <h2 class="d-font">Brief History</h2>
            <p>Damian is trained and mentored by Dick as Batman. Dick teaches Damian empathy and compassion for other people.
                Damian grows a lot under Dick's care, and they remain close to this day. When Dick returns from
                Spyral, Damian is the only one happy to see them. They both believe that "we were the best". Damian is
                Dick's Robin, and the only one Dick directly passed his mother's nickname to.</p>
            <p>When Bruce returns, Damian becomes his Robin. Though they had a rough start, they do eventually begin to
                work well together. Later, Damian is killed by his own clone, The Heretic, sent by his mother. Damian is
                eventually revived by the Chaos Shard. Damian joins the Teen Titans, and is especially close with Jon,
                Superman's son. Damian is the current Robin in comics, at 14 years old.</p>
