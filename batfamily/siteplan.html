        This website is a guide on the main four Robins! Batman has had many partners over the years, and together they make a vigilante family. If you didn't realize there was more than one Robin, this is the right place! Each Robin will get their own page, giving brief sections on backstory, history, and skills. Many have new identities, which will also be covered. Because there's a lot of media with many different authors, I've chosen to include what I think is most in character and realistic, and I've included the timelines that make the most sense. Due to time constriants, only 4 memebers of the "Bat Family" will be covered, but the Wayne Family also includes Alfred, Bruce, Cass, Duke, Stephanie, and more. If this website sparks your interest, check them out!

      <h3 class="rprimary">Richard (Dick) Grayson</h3>
      <h4 class="rsecondary2">Background</h4>
      <p>
        Dick grew up in the circus with his parents (Mary and John), and was an acrobat with them, the "Flying Graysons". When he was 8 and performing in Gotham, his parent's line was sabatoged by Tony Zucco, and they fell to their death. Dick was taken and put in a juvenile detention center (since social serves was full), but was later sent to an orphanage. He realized his parents were murdered, and snuck out at night, trying to avenge them. He was found by Batman, and adopted by Bruce Wayne. Batman helped him realize that killing Zucco would be wrong, and after training him, they put Zucco in jail. Dick created the Robin mantle, named after his mother's nickname for him (he was born on the first day of spring), with his family's colors. Dick started when he was 9, making him the first Robin, and the youngest to start.
      </p>
      <h4 class="rsecondary2">Brief History</h4>
      <p>
        As the first Robin, Dick is in a lot of comics and shows, and sometimes he seems to be in two places at once. As best as I can tell, he continues with Batman for a while, but also joins the Young Justice team (the first sidekick team). He also forms the first Team Titans group, and seems to be fighting crime with them in Jump City. Major events during his time as Robin include being severely wounded by Two-Face, and shot by the Joker. After both, he and Batman fight, and he's "fired" from being Robin. During his Teen Titan days, he's also briefly Deathstroke's (a well known contract killer) apprentice. Deathstroke put hidden bombs in his team's blood, and forced him to work with him. Dick managed to escape, and I'm uncertain if Batman ever found out about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After leaving the house (after being fired), Dick starts as a new vigilante in Bludhaven (the nearby city, which could rival Gotham in terms of average crime). He becomes Nightwing, named after a myth he heard from Superman. He and Batman aren't on good terms during this time, especially because Batman gave some random kid his old indentity. Though he is rightfully angry with Bruce, his relationship with Jason is okay. They're not the closest, but they do seem to get along reasonably well (they went on a ski trip). Jason dies while Dick is on a mission in space, and he finds out too late to come to the funeral. Dick actually hallocinates Jason a couple times after his death. When Tim asks him to be Robin, he refuses, but helps train Tim after.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things in Bludhaven aren't great. He joins the police to try and weed it of corruptions, but isn't able to actually do too much. The city is bombed by Deathstroke, though they have rebuilt. He also fought a villain named Blockbuster, who knew his indenity. Blockbuster blows up his apartment, and kills anyone Dick talks to. Blockbuster is eventually killed by Tarantula, someone Nightwing was working with, and he tries to turn himself in from guilt. Dick doesn't spend all his time in Bludhaven anymore, and splits time between there and Gotham. One good thing during his time there was that he found and adopted a three legged dog, who he named Haley (after the circus he grew up in).
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, Bruce is presumed dead and Dick takes over as Batman. Damian has recently arrived, so Dick is in charage of taking care of him. After Alfred gives Damian the Robin suit, Dick decides to keep him as Robin (which has the benefit of keeping him here, and not with assassins). Tim believes Bruce is still alive, but Dick just thinks he should get therapy. They fight, and Tim leaves. Dick and Damian protect the city together, and Dick teaches Damian to be more than just an assassin. After Tim finds Bruce and brings him back, Dick saves him from falling and returns to being Nightwing.
      </p>
      <p>
        One last part of his story is the Spyral timeline. Bruce doesn't act very nice, and it could be ignored as being out of character and weird, but it is a major part of Dick's life and experience. It starts with the Crime Syndicate capturing Dick, and hooking him up to a bomb that runs off his heart. He's killed by Lex Luthor to stop the bomb, and his heart is restarted after Batman freaks out. While he's recovering, Batman tells everyone he died, and they hold his funeral. When Dick wakes up, Batman tells him he needs to go undercover, because a new organization (Spyral) knows their identities. Dick disagrees with not telling his family he's alive, and he and Bruce fight. Dick ends up going on the mission, and has a cool (but also horrible) time as a spy, and he's sent on missions to collect organs from people with superpowers. Batman has memory loss, and Dick loses his only contact with the outside world. Eventually, he suceeds in bringing them down and is able to return to Gotham. Tim and Jason are mad at him for faking his death, and he never tells them the truth. I think they're getting along again though.

      <h3 class="jprimary">Jason Todd</h3>
      <h4 class="jsecondary2">Background</h4>
      <p>
        Jason is the son of Catherine and Willis Todd, and he was raised in Crime Alley. Willis was awful, and didn't return to the family after his prison sentence. It is later descovered that he was killed by Two-Face. His mom was kind, but addicted to drugs, and died of an overdose. Jason survived by himslef until he was caught stealing the tires off the Batmobile (at age 11) for money. Batman took Jason home, adopted him, and he became the next Robin at 12. Though he grew up in a tough area, Jason was a sweet kid who wanted to help people.
      </p>
      <h4 class="jsecondary2">Brief History</h4>
      <p>
        Jason and Batman worked well together, and Jason was a bright hope to Batman. When Jason was about 16, he finds out Catherine wasn't his birth mother. He tracks Sheila (his bio mom) down, and goes to Ethiopia alone to meet her. But it turns out that Sheila was working for the Joker, and betrays Jason. The Joker tortures Jason, and leaves him and his mom in a warehouse with bombs. Though Jason tries to save himself and his mom, the warhouse explodes and he dies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jason comes back from the dead years later at about 18 years old. He digs himself out of his own grave, but his mind doesn't seem to really be there. Eventually, the League of Assassins find him, and put him in the Lazarus Pit, where he is fully revived, but also more violent. He's trained by the League, and told that Batman not only didn't kill the Joker, but replaced him. He returns to Gotham, and fights Tim (his replacemnt) in Titans Tower. He become a crime lord, kills a lot of bad people, and creates a new identiy, the Red Hood. He confronts Batman about not killing the Joker, and tries to make him choose between him and the Joker. Batman chooses to save the Joker, and he and Jason don't get along for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Jason becomes a bit less violent and starts to work with Batman and the Robins. He joins a team called the Outlaws, and he protects Crime Alley. He spends his time fighting crime, and occasionally interacting with his family.

      <h3 class="tsecondary">Timothy (Tim) Drake</h3>
      <h4 class="taccent2a">Background</h4>
      <p>
        Tim was raised by his parents, Jack and Janet Drake. The Drake's lived in a mansion next door to the Waynes, and Tim's parents weren't around often. When Tim was a toddler, he went to the circus the Flying Grayson's were performing at. He met Dick, and watched saw his parents die. Because Tim was left alone so often, he grew bored and started to follow Batman and Robin around, taking pictures. He discovered their true identities, because Dick is one of the few people capible of doing a quadruple sumersault. After Jason died, Batman became violent, putting criminals in the hospital. Tim knew he needed help, needed a Robin to balance him. He went to Dick, and tried to convince him to return as Robin, but Dick refused. Since there was no one else, 14 year old Tim took the Robin costume (with Alfred's help) and went to rescue Batman and Nightwing. Bruce reluctantly took Tim as an aprentice, and Dick helped train and mentor Tim.
      </p>
      <h4 class="taccent2a">Brief History</h4>
      <p>
        During Tim's time as robin, he focused more on thinking and dective work than his predecessors. He was also trained by Lady Shiva, a famous assassin. Tim has had several bad encounters with the Joker. Tim was tortured and brainwashed by the Joker, and briefly became Joker Jr. Luckily, Tim was able to recover. On another occasion, he was wounded and deafeated by the Joker. When Nightwing came to save him, Joker made him believe Tim was dead, and mocked Jason's death. Tim meanwhile, was alive, and rushed over to join Nightwing. (Nightwing accidentally killed the Joker, but Batman was able to resuscitate him.) Tim is the leader of his generation of Young Justice, some of his best friends. Eventually, his parents die, and Tim is officially adopted by Bruce.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, Batman is presumed dead, but Tim believes him to be alive. However, the idea is so far fetched, no one believes him. After loosing Robin to Damian, Tim heads off on his own to rescue Bruce. He joins the League of Assassins, which has what he needs to succeed. However, their time together doesn't end well. At some point, Tim is injured, and while treating him the League just straight up steals his spleen. Tim gets revenge by blowing up many of the League's bases, and beating their leader, Ra's Al Ghul. During this adventure, Tim takes the mantle Red Robin, which is still is to this day.

      <h3 class="dprimary">Damian Wayne</h3>
      <h4 class="dsecondary2">Background</h4>
      <p>
        Damian is the biological son of Bruce and Talia Al Ghul. He was raised by the League of Assassins, and is a trained assassin. He grew up as heir, so he was both spoiled and abused. When Damian was 10, he was sent to Gotham to meet his father. After learning to kill, and being told that he would be the next Robin, Damian is dissapointed when he father is wary of him. Soon after arriving, with a still rocky relationship with his father, Bruce dies. Alfred gives Damian the Robin suit, and Dick officially makes Damian Robin so he won't return to the League of Assassins.
      </p>
      <h4 class="dsecondary2">Brief History</h4>
      <p>
        Damian is trained and mentored by Dick as Batman. Dick teaches Damian not to kill, and to have empathy. Damian grows a lot under the care of Dick, and they remain close to this day. When Dick returns from Spyral, Damian is the only one happy to see them. They both believe that "we were the best". Damian is Dick's Robin, and the only one Dick directly passed his mother's nickname to. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When Bruce returns, Damian becomes his Robin. Though they had a rough start, they do eventually begin to work well together. Later, Damian is killed by his own clone, The Heretic, sent by his mother. Damian is eventually revived by the Chaos Shard. Damian joins the Teen Titans, and is especially close with Jon, Superman's son. Damian is the current Robin in comics, at 14 years old.
